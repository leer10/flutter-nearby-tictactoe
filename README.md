# Flutter Tic Tac Toe 

This is simply me playing around with my previous project, trying to get it to support Tic Tac Toe. I didn't have a lot of patience, so often times the solution I picked was the first one I found -- even if it is messy and unorthodox. It's hacked together using Hive, pub_sub, and nearby_connections plugins from pub.dev. I put this online to show that it can be done. Others may use this to look at how it may be done, but this work is probably a long circuitous route to getting it done and there are definitely cleaner ways to do it
